Welcome to the NVDA planner addon project. 
This addon for NVDA is developed in python and aims to create checklist like functionality for the non visual desktop access screen reader. It will allow a user to quickly add items and events to a list which they can then either view or complete. 
I am also planning to add functionality to the addon which will allow the user to get notified before and when a particular event is supposed to be completed so it can be used as a planner of sorts.
